        <h2>1. Daigo vs Justin – Evo 2004</h2>
        <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the year is 2004, the game is Street Fighter III: Third Strike,  
        and the crowd is losing its mind. In the red corner, Daigo “The Beast” Umehara.  
        In the blue, Justin Wong, the reigning champion.  
        The match is down to the wire... one hit could end it all.  
        Then, against all odds, Daigo does the unthinkable: a perfect parry streak  
        that flips defeat into one of the greatest comebacks in esports history.  
        Welcome to Evo Moment #37.</p>

        <h2>2. Xmane vs Kiko – Street Fighter 6</h2>
        <p>The stage is electric, every eye fixed on the screen.  
        Kiko dominates early, landing punishing combos that push Xmane to the brink.  
        But just when it seems over, Xmane digs deep, weaving through pressure, reading every move,  
        and answering with precision counters.  
        The clock winds down, health bars nearly empty, and with one final, perfect punish,  
        Xmane clutches the win. The crowd erupts.  
        This is the stuff legends are made of.</p>

        <h2>3. The Alpha vs KMR | Snakefury – Tekken 8</h2>
        <p>Final round. Both fighters battered, both refusing to back down.  
        The Alpha controls the pace, dictating every exchange, the win seemingly in the bag.  
        But in the chaos of the brawl, one slip — a single mistimed move — opens the door.  
        Snakefury pounces, unleashing a brutal combo that flips the match on its head.  
        In the blink of an eye, victory turns to defeat.  
        The Alpha falls, and Snakefury walks away with the upset.</p>
