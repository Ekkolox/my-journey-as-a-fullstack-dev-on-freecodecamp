This repository documents my personal growth and practical progress through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s full-stack development curriculum. From HTML basics to full-stack web apps, this is my public roadmap, project archive, and personal proof-of-work.

## 📚 What’s Inside
- ✅ Certification projects (Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms, Frontend Libraries, APIs, and more)
- 📝 Study notes and code snippets
- 🌐 Live demos and deployed projects (where applicable)
- 🔄 Iterative improvements and refactoring as I learn

## 🧠 Why This Exists
To track my skills evolution, keep myself accountable, and share knowledge with fellow developers. Whether you're a beginner or mentor, feel free to fork, critique, or get inspired.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python etc
- React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- Git & GitHub (obviously)
